            We want to keep you informed about the development of ERCH and the
            Signal Vase mobile application. Currently, progress is hindered due
            to limited funds. The immobility in ERCH's development is a direct
            result of financial constraints.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Your support can make a significant difference. By contributing to
            Signal Vase, you are not only supporting the platform itself but
            also helping to accelerate the development of ERCH and its mobile
            app. Together, we can overcome these challenges and continue to
            innovate in the world of trading.
